# Homework #6: Rails VC of MVC and Feature Testing

Let's imagine yourself as a developer at the very beggining of the startup called twitter. Your colleague's computer has been attacked by hackers. Some parts of the project have been removed. Since he really loved that project, he managed to restore some of that parts but not all of it. That is great, since he restored user's sign in/sign up flow and tweeting functionality, but lost everything else...
You have to help him to recover all of the missing features. 
So let's start to work, because at Sunday's noon there should be a presentation for investors and the project of your life is under a huge risk...

So, what needs to be done?

You have a functionality that your colleague have done by himself, and also you have some feature tests for the functionality that should be done by yourself.

## Task description:

1. Add functionality for create and delete comments under tweets.

**Tip 0**: Start with creating appropriate model and integrating it into existing codebase. Don't forget about validations and unit testing here. Than proceed with controllers and views for that feature

**Tip 1** have a look on feature tests that were left for you, you can get important insights for your implementation from them :)

2. Add functionality for liking / disliking tweets and comments

3. Add integration tests for tweets creating flow

### Task acceptance criteria:
* `0` - Implemented functionality for commenting tweets that passes all test cases
* `1` - Implemented functionality for commenting and cover creating tweets with integration nad unit tests
* `2` - Implemented functionality for commenting, liking and cover creating tweets and liking with integration and unit tests
